Title:  

Explaining an AI Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) Predictions for Antibiotic Stewardship 

Scenario:  

An inpatient is in hospital and is receiving intravenous (IV) antibiotic treatment. An AI-model based clinical decision support system (CDSS) can help clinicians in the important decision on if and when to switch the patient from IV to oral antibiotics. The model has 5 input features that are numerical values between 0 and 1 derived from the patients' vitals time series data during their stay. Two thresholds can be used to transform the output of the model into a binary prediction, the first maximised the area under the receiver operating characteristic in the validation set while the second higher threshold minimised the false positive rate. If the AI CDSS prediction is 'Switch' using both thresholds the model believes changing the antibiotic administration route from IV to oral is appropriate. If the model prediction is outputting 'Switch' but the second higher threshold outputs 'Dont switch' the AI CDSS prediction is 'Potentially switch'. Alternatively, if the AI CDSS prediction is 'Dont witch' for both the model believes changing the antibiotic administration route from IV to oral is not appropriate, and that IV treatment should be continued. To help clinicians understand why the AI model predicts a patient should or should not switch they can view more details as shown in the attached image. 

Task:  

You are an expert in both the medical domain and AI explainability and interpretability. Your task is to provide an overall summary in the form of a couple of bullet points outlining why the AI CDSS made its prediction. You will be provided with CSV data containing the patients' vitals since antibiotic initiation. The attached image presents the explainability and interpretability information available to clinicians. This includes a table containing the patients' demographics, features, and the two model predictions shown under the 'AI CDSS prediction' and 'AI CDSS prediction (higher threshold)' columns. A table containing historical similar patient cases is also shown with their demographics, the models two predictions are again shown under the 'AI CDSS prediction'  and 'AI CDSS prediction (higher threshold)' columns, the real switch action that was taken is shown under the 'Real action' column, if the prediction was correct and aligns with the real action a yes is indicated in the 'Prediction matched real action' column otherwise it is No, if the higher threshold prediction was correct and aligns with the real action a yes is indicated in the 'Higher threshold Pprediction correct' column otherwise it is No. Finally, a feature contribution table indicates for the similar patients how each feature contributed towards the prediction. A red / orange colour indicates it led towards a more negative prediction (i.e., 'Dont switch'), while blue indicates a contribution towards the prediction 'Switch'. Green or teal is neutral and should be ignored. 

Instructions: 

1. Review the data and image: 
- Familiarise yourself with the provided CSV data containing the patients' vitals during their stay. 
- Examine the attached image, which encompasses demographics, features, clinical information, AI CDSS prediction, neighboring patient profiles, predicted and real and actions, and a feature contribution table. 

2. Patient Information: 
- Analyse the demographics, features and clinical details of the patient in question. 
- Identify key factors relevant to the decision-making process, such as age, sex, features, and vitals. 

3. Patient data: 
- Analyse the csv data provided and identify key trends that could link to the AI models prediction. 
- In particular focus on the last 24-hour period.  

4. Similar Patient Profiles: 
- Evaluate the demographics, and features of similar patients. 
- Compare the real actions taken for these similar patients with the actions predicted by the AI model. 

5. Feature Contribution Table: 
- Interpret the feature contribution table provided, indicating the impact of the features on the AI predictions for the neighboring patients. 
- Remember that a red / orange colour indicates it led towards a more negative prediction (i.e., 'Dont switch'), while blue indicates a contribution towards the prediction 'Switch'. Green or teal is neutral and should be ignored. 
- Discuss how the plot reflects the decision-making process and influences the AI model's prediction. 

6. Prediction Explanation: 
- Provide a comprehensive rationale for the AI model's prediction regarding the transition from IV to oral antibiotic therapy or the continuation of the current IV therapy. 
- Focus on logical reasoning over prior knowledge and consider all the information provided including the similarities and differences between the patient in question and the neighboring patients in terms of demographics, features, and predictions. 

Additional Guidance: 
- Utilise your medical expertise and understanding of AI explainability to interpret the information and situation provided. 
- Consider the complex and critical nature of medical decision-making for antibiotic stewardship. 
- Emphasise the potential significance of each factor in the AI CDSS prediction. 
- Ensure clarity, conciseness, coherence, and relevance in the explanation provided. 
- Do not make assumptions outside what the data indicates.

CSV Data: 



Conclusion:  

To repeat your task is to analyse the provided CSV data and image, summarise the information and provide guidance on why the AI CDSS made its prediction in a few bullet points, do not provide any other text. Please provide at least provide one bullet point related to the csv data and one that comments on the similar patients, feel free to include additional points as necessary based on your analysis.
