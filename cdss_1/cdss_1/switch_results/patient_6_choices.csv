0,a,dont_switch,"would investiagte why gcs 14 in last 24 hours, if not significant would consider IVOS"
1,b,switch,"The antibiotic should be stopped, not switched."
2,a,switch,"Fluctuating GCS appears to be the main problem. His comorbidities do not suggest this is normal for him. Assuming infection is the cause of this, he should be on broader antibiotics than fluclox.  "
3,b,switch,"markers look good, would need additional information (how wound looks, CRPp)"
4,a,switch,concerning feature her is lower GCS that seems to have improved meaning PO should now be a viable option for ongoing treatment 
5,b,switch,Clinically stable (except for brief drop in GCS to 14). I would switch and monitor for deterioration 
6,a,switch,Stop Abx. No clear rationale to continue. Vitals stable + no change since abx started
