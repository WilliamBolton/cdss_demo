tim,b,dont_switch,
0,a,dont_switch,"would reconsider if e.g. background copd, otherwise spo2 toooo low"
1,b,dont_switch,This patient is having septic shock.The BP has not improved.
2,a,dont_switch,Still has low sats.  This decision depends on the patient's baseline 02 saturation and what infection he is being treated for
3,b,switch,afebrile
4,a,dont_switch,low MAP WITHIN LAST FEW HOURS demonstrating possible sepsis
5,b,dont_switch,Markers of severity - borderline blood pressure and hypoxia
6,a,switch,Meet parameters
7,b,switch,"Stables vitals - nil temp spikes, good HR and BP"
8,a,dont_switch,Need further information regarding patient status and infection diagnosis. Could potentially switch to oral 
9,b,dont_switch,Would need to know what the diagnosis is. Would d/w Drs.
10,a,switch,"The higher AI thresholds seemed too conservative in this case, hence switch. "
11,b,dont_switch,"not enough info - CRP , WCC, What is being treated and with what ABx"
12,a,dont_switch,"day <2, low BP (septic shock?)"
13,b,dont_switch,"still some low BPs,lowish sats  i would reassess clinically if could be sepsis driven, may need a switch in iv?"
