tim,b,dont_switch,
0,a,dont_switch,"would reconsider if e.g. background copd, otherwise spo2 toooo low"
1,b,dont_switch,This patient is having septic shock.The BP has not improved.
2,a,dont_switch,Still has low sats.  This decision depends on the patient's baseline 02 saturation and what infection he is being treated for
3,b,switch,afebrile
4,a,dont_switch,low MAP WITHIN LAST FEW HOURS demonstrating possible sepsis
5,b,dont_switch,Markers of severity - borderline blood pressure and hypoxia
6,a,switch,Meet parameters
7,b,switch,"Stables vitals - nil temp spikes, good HR and BP"
8,a,dont_switch,Need further information regarding patient status and infection diagnosis. Could potentially switch to oral 
9,b,dont_switch,Would need to know what the diagnosis is. Would d/w Drs.
10,a,switch,"The higher AI thresholds seemed too conservative in this case, hence switch. "
11,b,dont_switch,"not enough info - CRP , WCC, What is being treated and with what ABx"
12,a,dont_switch,"day <2, low BP (septic shock?)"
13,b,dont_switch,"still some low BPs,lowish sats  i would reassess clinically if could be sepsis driven, may need a switch in iv?"
14,a,switch,CRP + WBC needed
15,b,switch,"Systolic improved, sats remain unchanged and afebrile"
16,a,switch,Clinically stable (despite low SpO2) - could switch to po abx to complete treatment.
17,b,dont_switch,was hypotensive and tacchy and decreased GCS on admission. would prob review in another 24-36 hrs (with micro and other investigations) and switch if remains improved
18,a,dont_switch,blood pressure low
19,b,switch,Doesn't look like infection. Possible stop depending on clinical details and WCC/CRP
20,a,switch,everything is starting to improve
21,b,switch,"pt GCS / BP improved since admission. no temp, HR and other observations stable "
22,a,dont_switch,"Low O2 Sat and unclear diagnosis. Would be helpful to have more lab data  (CRP, FBC)"
23,b,switch,48hrs with some clinical improvement and stability. No clear indication given so presuming nil needing special consideration and would IVOOS
24,a,dont_switch,low/down trending  oxygen saturations. Would want to understand this before switching.
