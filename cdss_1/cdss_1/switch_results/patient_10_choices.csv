tim,b,dont_switch,
0,a,dont_switch,"respiratory rate is erratic last 12 hours, if <20 would consider ivos, would investiagte why 14-24 last 12 hours"
1,b,switch,I cannot notice any signs of infections from the vital signs. The patient might not need antibiotic.
2,a,switch,obs improved
3,b,switch,"afebrile, appears to be stabilising"
4,a,dont_switch,MAP has been low only a few hours previously and therefore demonstrating signs of possible sepsis therefore continue on IV therapy
5,b,dont_switch,Some feature of severity - episodes of low blood pressure and mild hypoxia
6,a,dont_switch,Appears to have worsened in last 24 hours. Rereview with imaging/ diagnostics/ cultures
7,b,switch,Nil temp spikes - stable all round
8,a,dont_switch,Need further information on infection diagnosis and infection markers. Observations suggest an oral switch could be made. 
9,b,dont_switch,Need for info. Ptappears to be hypotensive for her age. Would d/w Drs. 
10,a,switch,"Although there was an episode of hypertension, no particular trends can be identified. "
11,b,dont_switch,"not enough info - need WCC, CRP and what is being treated"
12,a,switch,"almost 48th hour post admission, patient seems stable"
13,b,switch,I would want t reassess if low BP and sats are potentially sepsis driven and whether an alternative iv needed?
14,a,dont_switch,Reassess in 24 hours
15,b,switch,inflammatory markers would be useful here but given observations ok and no real change to variable response rate I would stop and observe
15,b,dont_switch,Latest response rate and sats are concerning. Needs further investigation to exclude infection before switch
16,a,switch,"Physiologically stable, if still needs abx, could be po."
17,b,switch,risks or IV outweigh benefits in this scenario. afebrile and haemodynamically stable
18,a,switch,
19,b,switch,
20,a,dont_switch,review in 24 hours
21,b,switch,"although BP has just dropped significantly on most recent observations, has had previous episodes (and unclear whether this could be sepsis driven or for other reasons) no other info on diagnosis /PMH that would help direct therapy in elderly patient who could be at risk of infections"
22,a,dont_switch,"Unclear how clinically stable is the patients with available viral signs. Will need more info (CRP, FBC) and diagnosis "
23,b,dont_switch,The recent desaturation would worry me this lady is not stable enough for IVOS
24,a,switch,I don't see a particular indication for continued IVs. She now has normal observations. Obviously fairly limited diagnosis. 
25,b,switch,Stop. Unclear why patient is on antibiotics.
