1,b,switch,It is difficult to decide without diagnosis.
2,a,switch,obs are basically normal now (but was tachypnoeic onfew  measurement s).
3,b,switch,"improving, afebrile"
4,a,switch,acknowledge that MAP has been falling from high baseline but all other parameters are ok and patient not hypotensive
5,b,switch,Seems stable with no features of severity
6,a,switch,meet parameters
7,b,switch,Vitals stable - nil temp spikes
8,a,dont_switch,Need further information on infection diagnosis and infection marker. Observations and patient demographics suggest an oral switch could be considered 
9,b,dont_switch,"Obs fine, but very limited info on diagnosis. Would d/w drs"
10,a,switch,
11,b,switch,probably had enough
12,a,switch,"day >2, patient is stable"
13,b,switch,appears clinically stable
14,a,switch,Look at CRP and WBC. Temp reducing. 
15,b,switch,No evidence of infection on initial observations and 57 with no comorbidities. Stop and observe
16,a,switch,"Clinically stable.  Indication for abx unclear, but physiologically certainly ready to switch to po."
17,b,switch,"again unclear if infection is a driver, vitals stabilised been ion IV for 4 days so would likely switch to stop"
18,a,switch,
19,b,dont_switch,NEWS>3 in one parameter. Need more clinical information
