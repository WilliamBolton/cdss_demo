tim,b,switch,
0,a,switch,"temps and other vitals all ok, and have been since started"
1,b,switch,I do not think this patient required IV antibiotic since the beginning.
2,a,dont_switch,"HR downtrending.  However, my decisionin real life would be based on her inflammatory markers (blood tests) and my clinical assessment of her cellulitis (how it looks and feels)"
3,b,switch,Would need documentation of how wound looks. Based on observations would switch.
4,a,switch,there are no concerning features that I can see that would require IV therapy and oral step down is reasonable
5,b,switch,"Signs of stability, although I would like to see the cellulite area to make sure that it is also improving and not expanding "
6,a,switch,Vitals all ok
7,b,switch,"Temp normal - no spikes, alert, GCS 15"
8,a,switch,No systemic features of severe infection. Would review infection markers + clinical response and step down to oral for a few more days 
9,b,switch,"Obs fine, long preceding course of abx. Would like to know how her leg is however. "

10,a,switch,"I would be interested in knowing whether the appearance of cellulitis is stable/improving (e.g., is it spreading or not?). All metrics are reassuring, although one has to be cautious in diabetic patients. I reviewed the AI recommendations, and note that none of the similar patients had cellulitis as an infection diagnosis. "
11,b,switch,"not enough info - WCC, CRP and appearance of cellulitis"
12,a,switch,"day 4, patient seems to improving (?), availability of oral drugs with same spectrum"
13,b,switch,"Assuming the cellulitis is clinically better, CRP responding"
14,a,dont_switch,not enough info to make a decision here. As diabetic would look to see if any swabs. Is it a simple cellulitis? Need WCC and CRP. Diabetic patients often have gram negative organisms
15,b,switch,Clinical improvement
15,b,switch,Would normally stop antimicrobials at this point
16,a,switch,"Clinically stable, has had 5 days of iv abx.  Could stop or switch to po for 2-5 more days."
17,b,switch,if cellulitis is clinically improving too i would switch to appropriate oral abx based on above
18,a,switch,appears ready for PO
19,b,switch,Infection parameters settled
20,a,switch,also need to monitor the cellulitis - is it improving.
21,b,switch,"5 days of Iv therapy (as per NEWS pt stable) - would want to know CRP, size and colour of cellulitis and if reducing (as often will be marked to help monitor infection)"
22,a,switch,"Not febrile, stable and soft tissue infection "
23,b,switch,Systemically well on an antibiotic with a clear oral switch. Clinical visual improvement in cellulitis would also help me make this decision with more confidence
