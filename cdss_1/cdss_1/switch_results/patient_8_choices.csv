tim,b,switch,
0,a,dont_switch,"what is indicaiton, would investigate why sats dropped and if significant would review 24 hours"
1,b,dont_switch,There is not enough information and this patient was comatose. Better do no harm.
2,a,dont_switch,"Patient is still unwell withlow BPs, tachycardic and desaturated during last few hours.  I would NOT switch to oral abx (but i would probably switch to a broader IV abx)"
3,b,switch,"patient improving, afebrile and had 6 days of IV"
4,a,dont_switch,at hour 125 (of 126) the systolic BP was 95 and MAP 69. I would persist with IV route due to possible severity of infection
5,b,dont_switch,"Still remains tachycardic, I would look to other data like WBC and CRP to help guide this decision. If they were both falling I may switch"
6,a,dont_switch,Review cultures/ sensitivities / imaging / diagnostics. If none available ? stop and reculture.
7,b,switch,Vitals all stable - nil temp spikes
8,a,dont_switch,Trends in observations suggest oral switch could be made but need further information regarding infection diagnosis and infection markers
9,b,dont_switch,Not enough info. Would like to know diagnosis from Drs
10,a,switch,"I don't think i can pick out specific trends in vital signs. Borderline decision. In this case, knowing WCC/CRP might help decision."
11,b,switch,"Probably ok, but I would want CRP, WCC"
12,a,switch,"day 6, clinically stable"
13,b,switch,"6 days and vitals better, most things can de-escalate by now"
14,a,switch,Need CRP and WBC.
15,b,dont_switch,Patient had reduced GCS - unclear if this is meningoencephalitis. If so would need 10 days empirical treatment at least. Need CSF to clarify diagnosis and treatment duration
16,a,switch,"Clinically stable.  Once indication clear, duration can be decided, but certainly no need for further iv abx."
17,b,switch,vitals/GCS improved. unclear if infection driving any of this so would stop and review
18,a,dont_switch,not enough information
18,a,dont_switch,i don't knew whether he has a serious infection e.g. meningitis
18,a,dont_switch,need more info
19,b,switch,Stop. ? evidence of infection. Already had 6 days ABx. Need WCC and CRP and more clinical information
20,a,dont_switch,BP still low - clinical input needed
21,b,switch,again PMH/indication helpful as treatment already has been 6 days IV. Tool helped to confirm other patients had switched and higher prediction provides stronger evidence
22,a,switch,Has completed 6 days of IV antibiotics already. Final decision will depend on diagnosis and type of antibiotics 
23,b,dont_switch,I'm not convinced there is sufficient clinical improvement to IVOST. I be considering recapturing or resampling here. I could perhaps be convinced in the setting of markedly improved inflammatory markers or clinical picture
24,a,switch,"Very limited information here, but based on largely normal observations and the assumption that there is no 'special infection' indication for IVs, I would be inclined to switch to orals. "
25,b,switch,"Stop,. unclear why pt is on antibiotics. Per-work up patient."
