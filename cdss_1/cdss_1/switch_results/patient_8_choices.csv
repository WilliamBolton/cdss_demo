tim,b,switch,
0,a,dont_switch,"what is indicaiton, would investigate why sats dropped and if significant would review 24 hours"
1,b,dont_switch,There is not enough information and this patient was comatose. Better do no harm.
2,a,dont_switch,"Patient is still unwell withlow BPs, tachycardic and desaturated during last few hours.  I would NOT switch to oral abx (but i would probably switch to a broader IV abx)"
3,b,switch,"patient improving, afebrile and had 6 days of IV"
4,a,dont_switch,at hour 125 (of 126) the systolic BP was 95 and MAP 69. I would persist with IV route due to possible severity of infection
5,b,dont_switch,"Still remains tachycardic, I would look to other data like WBC and CRP to help guide this decision. If they were both falling I may switch"
6,a,dont_switch,Review cultures/ sensitivities / imaging / diagnostics. If none available ? stop and reculture.
7,b,switch,Vitals all stable - nil temp spikes
8,a,dont_switch,Trends in observations suggest oral switch could be made but need further information regarding infection diagnosis and infection markers
9,b,dont_switch,Not enough info. Would like to know diagnosis from Drs
10,a,switch,"I don't think i can pick out specific trends in vital signs. Borderline decision. In this case, knowing WCC/CRP might help decision."
11,b,switch,"Probably ok, but I would want CRP, WCC"
12,a,switch,"day 6, clinically stable"
13,b,switch,"6 days and vitals better, most things can de-escalate by now"
