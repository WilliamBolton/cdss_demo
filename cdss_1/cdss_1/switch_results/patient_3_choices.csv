tim,b,dont_switch,
0,a,dont_switch,"temp and HR increasing, GCS dropped in last 24 hours"
1,b,dont_switch,"This patient is not improving and should be evaluated for other differential diagnoses, investigated for complications, or evaluated for the pos of drug resistance or other causative pathogens."
2,a,switch,Becoming febrile.  Without any additionalo data I have to assume pt is not responding to current abx and need to switch
3,b,dont_switch,"patient now has temperatures, would review with cultures, for potentially switching IV or adding second agent (atypical cover?/)"
4,a,switch,As long as GCS does not impair his ability to take PO aux then a switch seems reasonable. The recent GCS is 15. If it were lower I would persist with IV
5,b,dont_switch,signs that the infection has not started to resolve - continued pyrexia. I would look for other evidence of improvement such as CRP or white cell count. 
6,a,dont_switch,Switch IV abx or need to be able to view more diagnostics and imaging/ needs to stabilise first. 
7,b,dont_switch,Temp rising on ceftriaxone - ?consider alternative/escalate. O2 sats reducing too
8,a,dont_switch,"Rising temperature. Would also like to see CRP,WBC and micro results "
9,b,dont_switch,"Needs further IX as still febrile after 3 days of ceftriaxone, rpt CXR, ?foreign travel etc "
10,a,dont_switch,"Febrile, with episode of low BP and confusion. I would be concerned for complications of pneumonia such as empyema, so would ask for a chest x-ray. Also could be atypical pneumonia so would test for this. "
11,b,dont_switch,still febrile
12,a,dont_switch,i would change the IV antibiotic
13,b,switch,"on going fever but I wouldn't switch in isolation, clinical reasesss also eg correct diagnosis, empyema"
14,a,dont_switch,need to look at CRP and WCC too. Probably would escalate treatment to another broader spectrum antibiotic
15,b,dont_switch,Patient remains febrile with reducing sats. 
16,a,switch,"He's had 3 days of iv abx, although the patient remains febrile, all of his other markers are favourable.  If no empyema (or effusion clinically) I would switch to po abx."
17,b,switch,"would switch to different IV. increasingly febrile, labile BP and GCS  despite 3 days cef, would need repeat septic screen and risk assessment for MDRO"
18,a,switch,still pyrexial unsure if this is ongoing pneumonia or another infection (e.g. C. difficile; line infection; virus). Would like procalcitonin; CRP and clinical details
19,b,dont_switch,Temperature still raised
20,a,dont_switch,"temp and rest rate going up, might try a different IV option"
